V8 Benchmarks

Simple framework for running the benchmark suites and
computing a score based on the timing measurements.

----

Originally the v8 benchmarks are made to test the performance of the
V8 JavaScript engine used in the Google Chrome browser.

Subsequently the v8 benchmarks have been ported to ActionScript (typed and untyped)
to run the same benchmarks under the Tamarin virtual machine
used in the Flash Player plugin.

My very small contribution is to have
 - reorganized and cleaned up a bit the code
 - added some code to run the benchmarks asynchronously
 - added a build to package a SWC
